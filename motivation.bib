	abstract = "{High-repetition-rate (HRR) experiments can collect large datasets with high temporal, spatial, and/or parametric resolution or large numbers of repeat measurements for statistics. HRR experiments also enable new experimental designs, including active feedback control loops and novel diagnostics, that can improve the reproducibility as well as the quantity of measurements. Together, these attributes make HRR experiments ideal for performing high-quality repeatable science. Until recently, these techniques have not been applied to high-energy-density–physics (HEDP) experiments, which are typically restricted to repetition rates of a few per day. However, recent advancements in lasers, pulsed-power drivers, target fabrication, and diagnostics are starting to change this fact, opening an exciting new frontier of HRR HEDP experiments. A mini-conference on this subject at the 2021 meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics brought together members of this growing community. The “High Repetition Rate Frontier in High-Energy-Density Physics” special topic in Physics of Plasmas highlights current progress in this exciting area.}",

The results obtained can be applied to the optimization of ion acceleration by the laser radiation pressure with mass-limited targets.}",
