	abstract = "{Ultra-intense lasers are a promising source of energetic ions for various applications. An interesting approach described in Ferri et al. [Commun. Phys. 2, 40 (2019)] argues from particle-in-cell simulations that using two laser pulses of half energy (half intensity) arriving with close to 45° angle of incidence is significantly more effective at accelerating ions than one pulse at full energy (full intensity). For a variety of reasons, at the time of this writing, there has not yet been a true experimental confirmation of this enhancement. In this paper, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations to examine if a millijoule class, 5×1018 W cm−2 peak intensity laser system could be used for such a demonstration experiment. Laser systems in this class can operate at a kHz rate which should be helpful for addressing some of the challenges of performing this experiment. Despite investigating a 3.5 times lower intensity than Ferri et al. [Commun. Phys. 2, 40 (2019)] did, we find that the double pulse approach enhances the peak proton energy and the energy conversion to protons by a factor of about three compared to a single laser pulse with the same total laser energy. We also comment on the nature of the enhancement and describe simulations that examine how the enhancement may depend on the spatial or temporal alignment of the two pulses.}",

	abstract = "{We investigate the target normal sheath acceleration of protons in thin aluminum targets irradiated at a relativistic intensity by two time-separated ultrashort (35 fs) laser pulses. When the full-energy laser pulse is temporally split into two identical half-energy pulses, and using target thicknesses of 3 and 6 μm, we observe experimentally that the second half-pulse boosts the maximum energy and charge of the proton beam produced by the first half-pulse for time delays below ∼0.6–1 ps. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the variation of the proton energy spectra with respect to the time-delay between the two pulses. We demonstrate that the expansion of the target front surface caused by the first pulse significantly enhances the hot-electron generation by the second pulse arriving after a few hundreds of fs time delay. This enhancement, however, does not suffice to further accelerate the fastest protons driven by the first pulse once three-dimensional quenching effects have set in. This implies a limit to the maximum time delay that leads to proton energy enhancement, which we theoretically determine.}",
