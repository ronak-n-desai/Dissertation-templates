	abstract = "{Ultra-intense lasers are a promising source of energetic ions for various applications. An interesting approach described in Ferri et al. [Commun. Phys. 2, 40 (2019)] argues from particle-in-cell simulations that using two laser pulses of half energy (half intensity) arriving with close to 45° angle of incidence is significantly more effective at accelerating ions than one pulse at full energy (full intensity). For a variety of reasons, at the time of this writing, there has not yet been a true experimental confirmation of this enhancement. In this paper, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations to examine if a millijoule class, 5×1018 W cm−2 peak intensity laser system could be used for such a demonstration experiment. Laser systems in this class can operate at a kHz rate which should be helpful for addressing some of the challenges of performing this experiment. Despite investigating a 3.5 times lower intensity than Ferri et al. [Commun. Phys. 2, 40 (2019)] did, we find that the double pulse approach enhances the peak proton energy and the energy conversion to protons by a factor of about three compared to a single laser pulse with the same total laser energy. We also comment on the nature of the enhancement and describe simulations that examine how the enhancement may depend on the spatial or temporal alignment of the two pulses.}",

	abstract = "{We investigate the target normal sheath acceleration of protons in thin aluminum targets irradiated at a relativistic intensity by two time-separated ultrashort (35 fs) laser pulses. When the full-energy laser pulse is temporally split into two identical half-energy pulses, and using target thicknesses of 3 and 6 μm, we observe experimentally that the second half-pulse boosts the maximum energy and charge of the proton beam produced by the first half-pulse for time delays below ∼0.6–1 ps. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the variation of the proton energy spectra with respect to the time-delay between the two pulses. We demonstrate that the expansion of the target front surface caused by the first pulse significantly enhances the hot-electron generation by the second pulse arriving after a few hundreds of fs time delay. This enhancement, however, does not suffice to further accelerate the fastest protons driven by the first pulse once three-dimensional quenching effects have set in. This implies a limit to the maximum time delay that leads to proton energy enhancement, which we theoretically determine.}",

This has been studied in one dimension with both Vlasov and particle-in-cell codes. A reduction in the maximum proton energy, and the generation of spectral peaks, is observed. This is the first theoretical demonstration of spectral peak generation by purely optical means. The mechanism, which has been termed multiple pulse sheath acceleration, that produces these spectral peaks is described, and the same mechanism occurs in both sets of simulations.}

The two cases of (i) normally incident single laser pulse, and (ii) two obliquely incident laser pulses are thoroughly examined. It is shown that the two-oblique-pulse configuration combined with an external magnetic field results in a stronger enhancement (56 MeV–75 MeV) in the protons’ cutoff energies than the normally incident single laser pulse with an external magnetic field (19 MeV–24 MeV). This combination of two-oblique laser pulses along with a kilo-Tesla level external magnetic field is therefore found to be highly effective in accelerating protons/ions in the TNSA regime.}

	abstract = {Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we examine how an externally applied strong magnetic field impacts proton acceleration in laser-irradiated solid-density targets. We find that a kT-level external magnetic field can sufficiently inhibit transverse transport of hot electrons in a flat laser-irradiated target. While the electron heating by the laser remains mostly unaffected, the reduced electron transport during proton acceleration leads to an enhancement of maximum proton energies and the overall number of energetic protons. The resulting proton beam is much better collimated compared to a beam generated without applying a kT-level magnetic field. A factor of three enhancement of the laser energy conversion efficiency into multi-MeV protons is another effect of the magnetic field. The required kT-level magnetic fields are becoming feasible due to a significant progress that has been made in generating magnetic fields with laser-driven coils using ns-long laser pulses. The possibility of improving characteristics of laser-driven proton beams using such fields is a strong motivation for further development of laser-driven magnetic field capabilities.}

Here, we investigate how to optimize their coupling with solid targets. Experimentally, we show that overlapping two intense lasers in a mirror-like configuration onto a solid with a large preplasma can greatly improve the generation of hot electrons at the target front and ion acceleration at the target backside. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed through multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations, revealing that the self-induced magnetic fields driven by the two laser beams at the target front are susceptible to reconnection, which is one possible mechanism to boost electron energization. In addition, the resistive magnetic field generated during the transport of the hot electrons in the target bulk tends to improve their collimation. Our simulations also indicate that such effects can be further enhanced by overlapping more than two laser beams.},
