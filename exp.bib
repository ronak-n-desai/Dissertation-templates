Measurements of emission from multiple‐beam experiments and from experiments at 1.06 μm wavelength are also described. Some simple models are used for discussion and correlation of the data.}",

	abstract = "{Fast‐ion production in laser plasmas with a truncated Maxwellian velocity distribution of hot electrons is investigated by using a new numerical method, namely the systematic Newton’s iteration method which has been applied to nonlinear equations. The analysis of the temporal evolution of coronal plasma expansion discloses that the ion‐front velocity approaches a constant value within thirty ion plasma oscillation periods, when the high‐energy tail is truncated. In such a case, the maximum ion velocity is found to be proportional to the maximum energy of hot electrons. Consequently, the ion velocity distributions are steepened and truncated. Furthermore, it is found that the energy partition of the absorbed laser energy to fast ions is appreciably reduced when the maximum electron energy is below a few times the hot‐electron temperature.}",

Strong correlation has been found between the bulk energy per AMU for fast ions measured by charge cups and the x‐ray‐determined hot electron temperature. Five theoretical models have been used to explain this correlation. The models include (1) a steady‐state spherically symmetric fluid model with classical electron heat conduction, (2) a steady‐state spherically symmetric fluid model with flux limited electron heat conduction, (3) a simple analytic model of an isothermal rarefaction followed by a free expansion, (4) the lasnex hydrodynamics code [Comments Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 2, 85 (1975)], calculations employing a spherical expansion and simple initial conditions, and (5) the lasnex code with its full array of absorption, transport, and emission physics. The results obtained with these models are in good agreement with the experiments and indicate that the detailed shape of the correlation curve between mean fast ion energy and hot electron temperature is due to target surface impurities at the higher temperatures (higher laser intensities) and to the expansion of bulk target material at the lower temperatures (lower laser intensities). }",
