On the right, the electrons are displaced by a distance $x$ creating a charge separation and electric field akin to a parallel-plate capacitor directed towards the right.

Brighter colors show a higher value of $\phi $. In the center panel, the debye length $\lambda _D$ is shown.}}{7}{figure.caption.13}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.3}{\ignorespaces Absorption fraction as a function of incidence angle $\theta _i$. For resonance absorption, the density scale length $L_p$ is varied in terms of the laser wavelength $\lambda = \SI {0.8}{\mu \meter }$. For the Brunel mechanism, fractions are plotted for two regimes $a_0 \ll 1$ (where a value of $a_0 = 0.1$ was chosen) and for $a_0 \gg 1$ (which has no dependence on $a_0$).}}{10}{figure.caption.17}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.5}{\ignorespaces The Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) process is depicted. First, an intense laser pulse irradiates the front side of a target foil of few $\mu m$ thickness. This generates hot electrons that stream through the foil and re-emerge in a cloud on the rear side. The charge separation of the hot electrons and positively charged target creates intense longitudinal fields ($\sim $ TV/m) that accelerate light ions in the mostly target normal direction.
